Release Notes
=============

CernVM 4.3
----------
CernVM 4.3 is a minor update to CernVM 4.2. It upgrades the base system to
EL 7.7 and provides new versions of the docker and eos packages. Note that in
the course of the EOS update, that eosd daemon disappeared. Instead, eos mounts
are now autofs managed, in the same way they are on CERN lxplus.

CernVM 4.2
----------
CernVM 4.2 is a minor update to CernVM 4.1, upgrading the base system to EL 7.6.
